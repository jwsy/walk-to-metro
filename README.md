Walk to Metro based on Ionic App Base
=====================================

This app helps you know when to walk to the DC metro stop of your choice and not wait longer than three minutes.

## Using this project

This was built with the [Ionic Framework version 1 ](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli)

First, you'll need to get an free API key from the [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Developer Site](https://developer.wmata.com/).

Second, you'll have to add that key into _www/js/services.js.stub_ and rename the file to _www/js/services.js_

Once that's done, use the ionic cli to serve or emulate

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
